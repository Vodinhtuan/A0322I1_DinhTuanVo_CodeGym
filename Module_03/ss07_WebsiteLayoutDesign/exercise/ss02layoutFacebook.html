    2006–2012: Public access, Microsoft alliance, and rapid growth
    In May 2006, Facebook hired its first intern, Julie Zhuo.[47] After a month, Zhuo was hired as a full-time engineer.[47] On September 26, 2006, Facebook opened to everyone at least 13 years old with a valid email address.[48][49][50] By late 2007, Facebook had 100,000 pages on which companies promoted themselves.[51] Organization pages began rolling out in May 2009.[52] On October 24, 2007, Microsoft announced that it had purchased a 1.6% share of Facebook for $240 million ($314 million in 2021 dollars[29]), giving Facebook a total implied value of around $15 billion ($19.6 billion in 2021 dollars[29]). Microsoft's purchase included rights to place international advertisements.[53][54]
    In May 2007, at the first f8 developers conference, Facebook announced the launch of the Facebook Developer Platform, providing a framework for software developers to create applications that interact with core Facebook features. By the second annual f8 developers conference on July 23, 2008, the number of applications on the platform had grown to 33,000, and the number of registered developers had exceeded 400,000.[55]
    The website won awards such as placement into the "Top 100 Classic Websites" by PC Magazine in 2007,[56] and winning the "People's Voice Award" from the Webby Awards in 2008.[57
    On July 20, 2008, Facebook introduced "Facebook Beta", a significant redesign of its user interface on selected networks. The Mini-Feed and Wall were consolidated, profiles were separated into tabbed sections, and an effort was made to create a cleaner look.[58] Facebook began migrating users to the new version in September 2008.[59]
    In October 2008, Facebook announced that its international headquarters would locate in Dublin, Ireland.[60] In September 2009, Facebook said that it had achieved positive cash flow for the first time.[61] A January 2009 Compete.com study ranked Facebook the most used social networking service by worldwide monthly active users.[62][better source needed] China blocked Facebook in 2009 following the Ürümqi riots.[63]
    In 2010, Facebook won the Crunchie "Best Overall Startup Or Product" award[64] for the third year in a row.[65
    The company announced 500 million users in July 2010.[66] Half of the site's membership used Facebook daily, for an average of 34 minutes, while 150 million users accessed the site from mobile devices. A company representative called the milestone a "quiet revolution."[67] In October 2010 groups were introduced.[68] In November 2010, based on SecondMarket Inc. (an exchange for privately held companies' shares), Facebook's value was $41 billion ($50.9 billion in 2021 dollars[29]). The company had slightly surpassed eBay to become the third largest American web company after Google and Amazon.com.[69][70]
    On November 15, 2010, Facebook announced it had acquired the domain name fb.com from the American Farm Bureau Federation for an undisclosed amount. On January 11, 2011, the Farm Bureau disclosed $8.5 million ($10.2 million in 2021 dollars[29]) in "domain sales income", making the acquisition of FB.com one of the ten highest domain sales in history.[71]
    In February 2011, Facebook announced plans to move its headquarters to the former Sun Microsystems campus in Menlo Park, California.[72][73] In March 2011, it was reported that Facebook was removing about 20,000 profiles daily for violations such as spam, graphic content and underage use, as part of its efforts to boost cyber security.[74] Statistics showed that Facebook reached one trillion page views in the month of June 2011, making it the most visited website tracked by DoubleClick.[75][76] According to a Nielsen study, Facebook had in 2011 become the second-most accessed website in the U.S. behind Google.[77][78]
